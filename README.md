# Hilo
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. 
The rules are simple. You start with 300 points. A card is drawn. Guess whether the next card drawn will have a higher number or a lower number. Each successful guess adds 100, and each incorrect guess subtracts 75.
As long as you have at least 1 point, you can play again.
